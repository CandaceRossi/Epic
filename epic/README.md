## Project Overview

Epic Painting & Powerwashing is a for profit painting and powerwashing company local to the Fort Myers, Florida area. This company has a need for online presence where clients can see the services offered, check out works and projects previously done by Epic Painting & Powerwashing, and to be able to contact them to schedule services.

Using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) on the front-end, I helped make its list of services easily accessible and descriptive and give the client the ability to contact the company via form.

### Key Features

Clients are interested in seeing services Epic Painting & Powerwashing offers. Clients are interested in seeing project work of the company's portfolio. Clients are interested in contacting the company through the website by form and to find their social media platforms.

- Single page app for seperate service pages
- Images of portfolio with descriptions
- Ability to see portfolio work with pop up modal
- Contact form on both home page and contact page
- Social media 

## Tech Stack

### Front-end built using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Currently industry standard for web applications, using React let me manage displaying large amounts of data effectively by implementing Components.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS compiler helped me iterate more quickly on styling with the efficient use of nesting.
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): Accessible friendly industry standard for components with React, React-Bootstrat replaces the Bootstrap library JavaScript, while maintaining the Bootstrap compatibility getting the benefit of the world's largest UI ecosystem.
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): AOS is an animation library that triggers animation on scroll, while still allowing to be manipulated by css where necessary. 

#### Front-end deployed to [AWS](https://www.epicbeta.netlify.app).

#### [Back-end]() built using:

- Node.js
- Axios
- Knex
- MySQL
- Jest

My reasoning behind using the above tools for the back-end build is to make transferring client information to the company with efficiency. Alongside Node and Express for operation set up, we are using RESTful API through Axios call to one single API endpoint.

# API

- [Axios]()
- Please see Back-end documentation [here]().

# Testing

I tested the site in Chrome and Firefox using Jest.

# Installation Instructions

- After cloning or pulling repository for the first time, run "yarn install" in the app directory called /sauti.
- Run "yarn start" in /sauti directory to start react app.

## Other Scripts

- build - creates a build of the application
- test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
